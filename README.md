# harbour-Berlin-Vegan

harbour-Berlin-Vegan is the [SailfishOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS) version
of the Berlin-Vegan guide. There is also a [FOSS Android version](https://github.com/Berlin-Vegan/berlin-vegan-guide).

With the Berlin-Vegan guide, you have got quick access to an overview of the vegan
food and shopping possibilities in Berlin, Germany --- even while you are out and about.

The app contains over 300 entries of restaurants, snack bars and takeaways with
vegan declared offers from the www.berlin-vegan.de website.

The guide is not just suitable for vegetarians and vegans but also for all people who are
trying to live their life in a greener and more animal friendly way.
