for javafile in `find -name \*.java`; do  cat licenseHeader.txt $javafile > temp; cat temp > $javafile; done

* JSONPath OR gel?

* gel ---> as git submodule
      ---> as rpm dependendy --> mail 2 sailfish dev list

* Transfer bascially this file to Gitlab / Github issue list (linkability between tickets and git commits)
  * Find out a way to sync gitlab and github projects (including issue numbers in the best case!)
* Description height issue (Bindining loop ++ sometimes wrong)
* Opening hours small to few to see
* Opening hours sunday-tuesday issue
------------------------------------

* Implement list ordered by position
  --> Find a solution for the case a position is not available
      (async stuff needed probably)
  ---> Use https://github.com/Cutehacks/gel?
  ---> Look at <componentgallery/qml/pages/SearchPage.qml:251>
* Automatically check for new JSON file on app startup and download new version
* Tablet experience
* Map! -> QtLocation map?
       -> Maep?
       -> harbour-mapp? --> https://github.com/unsanded/harbour-mapp
       -> poor maps? https://github.com/otsaloma/poor-maps
       -> https://together.jolla.com/question/51587/a-map-component-for-sailfish-apps/
* Improve detail view
* Make images be flickable?
* Extent sources (merge in sources from vebu, HappyCow, etc.)
* Improve sexiness: 
  * Parallax scrolling 
  * Animations
  * Inert (slow) Animation of background rectangle (Windows Phone like) 
* abstract the calculations in GastroLocationDetails  into functions and/or variables --- this is ugly (code wise) otherwise.
   => Mostly done
* Move more parts of GastroLocationDetails into their own components

* Condense opening hours
        Inspiration sources:
            * Android BVApp:
              berlin-vegan-guide/app/src/main/java/org/berlin_vegan/bvapp/data/Location.java
* Make these detail elements be collapsible
        Inspiration sources:
            * Jolla Store: Detail desciption / collapsible -> /usr/share/store-client/pages/AppPageDetails.qml (only as an inspiration, do not copy the code --> NO FOSS so far)
            * Harbour-Warehouse: /usr/share/harbour-warehouse/qml/components/TextCollapsible.qml
            * TAO translator: /usr/share/harbour-taot/qml/ExpandableLabel.qml / https://github.com/leppa/taot/blob/master/qml/sailfish/ExpandableLabel.qml
