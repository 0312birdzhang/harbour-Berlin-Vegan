* Transfer bascially this file to Gitlab / Github issue list (linkability between tickets and git commits)
  * Find out a way to sync gitlab and github projects (including issue numbers in the best case!)

* Implement list ordered by position
  --> Find a solution for the case a position is not available
      (async stuff needed probably)
  ---> Use https://github.com/Cutehacks/gel?
  ---> Look at <componentgallery/qml/pages/SearchPage.qml:251>
* Download JSON file
* Tablet experience
* Map! -> QtLocation map?
       -> Maep?
       -> harbour-mapp? --> https://github.com/unsanded/harbour-mapp
       -> poor maps? https://github.com/otsaloma/poor-maps
       -> https://together.jolla.com/question/51587/a-map-component-for-sailfish-apps/
* Improve detail view
* Extent sources (merge in sources from vebu, HappyCow, etc.)
* Improve sexiness: 
  * Parallax scrolling 
  * Animations
  * Inert (slow) Animation of background rectangle (Windows Phone like) 
* abstract the calculations in GastroLocationDetails  into functions and/or variables --- this is ugly (code wise) otherwise.
   => Mostly done
* Move more parts of GastroLocationDetails into their own components
* Tablet: Analyze actual Jolla QML files from tablet and phone to find out about how to treat the tablet

* Porting app to Android / iOS?
  
* How to trigger navigation "intent"?

* Intents ("Get directions" with Android-Apps as an option)
